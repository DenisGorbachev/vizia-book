# Architecture



## Bindings
Bindings are a special kind of view which allow the user to explicitly declare which views should be updated when the bound data changes.

```rust
Binding::new(cx, AppData::data, |cx, data|{
    Label::new()
});
```

## Lenses
Bindings and some views, such as `List`, take a lens as an argument. A lens allows us to reference a piece of data from its container, such as a field of a struct. Lenses are generated by the lens derive macro:

```rust
#[derive(Lens)]
struct AppData {
    data: String,
}
```

Under-the-hood a lens is just a static instance of a zero-sized type, generated for us by the derive macro, which implements the `Lens` trait. The `Lens` trait has a single function, `view()`, which takes a reference to the container and returns a reference to the piece of data. The static instance is given the same name as the field and placed in a module with the same name as the struct, allowing us to use it as `AppData::data`.  

A lens provides fine-grained reactivity to the Vizia data system. When a binding is created a copy of the lens is stored along with
