# Accessibility



## Keyboard Navigation and Control

One aspect of accessibility is the ability to navigate and manipulate a user interface using just a keyboard. Vizia provides built-in focus handling with the `tab` key moving the focus to the next view, and the `shift + tab` key combination moving the focus to the previous view.

### Focus Styling
The `:focus` pseudoclass selector can be used in CSS to apply styling when a view gains focus:

```rust
```

## Screen Reader Support

Vizia does not yet support screen readers. However, we are working on it, so check back soon!
