# Styling

Styling refers to modifying the visual properties of a view, such as its background color, border color, etc. A full list of available style properties can be found on the [style properties](./style_properties.md) page.

There are two methods for styling views in Vizia:

1. [Inline](./inline.md) - which applies style properties directly to a view.
2. [Shared](./shared.md) - which uses CSS rules to apply styling to any views which match the rules.
