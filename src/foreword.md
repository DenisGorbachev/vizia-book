Welcome to Vizia!

Vizia is a crate for building GUI applications.
It presently supports Windows, Linux, and MacOS targets, as well as VST plugins.

The Vizia project's home is [https://github.com/vizia]().
The main Vizia repository is [https://github.com/vizia/vizia](), where the actual UI code lives.

This book hopes to teach you how to use Vizia, whether or not you've done any GUI programming in the past.
