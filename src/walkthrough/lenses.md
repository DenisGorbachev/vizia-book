# All About Lenses

Lenses are property getter objects, allowing you to "select" some part of the model (or data derived from the model) and inspect it at will. These objects are passed to bindings to let them store the fact that you would like to bind to something specific.

- lens.then()
- lens.map()

You can pass lenses to property setters as a shorthand to create an expression binding.
